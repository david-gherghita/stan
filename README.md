# Smart Targets for Airsoft and Nerf

The project centers around creating a smart target system for airsoft or Nerf guns using a network of ESP32 boards. Each ESP32 acts as a target that can be placed independently, communicating wirelessly with a central control unit.

## Software Instructions

1. If on Windows, download the CP210x USB to UART Bridge driver for the ESP32 boards from [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads).

2. Install [Arduino IDE 2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. In Arduino IDE, set `Sketchbook location` to the root of this git repository.

4. Now you should be able to compile the programs in `src` successfully.
